    Hello! Welcome to my analytics lab. Here I publish my research and work on data analytics and mathematical optimization. Please stay tuned to follow my posts, projects, and tutorials on data analytics and mathematical optimization.  <br>
  <br>
  I am a Ph.D. in Operations Research (OR). I am currently working as a freelancer data and optimization scientist.  You may see my UpWork profile from <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0125073517d8c05c6b" target="_blank">here.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
    I am in love with R and have been using it for analytics for over nine years. I have hands-on experience with also Python, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I mostly use LATEX for preparing manuscripts. I have been using the GUROBI solver extensively for mathematical programming
  <br>
  <br>
    Before exploring my lab, I strongly encourage you to read a recent article published in Forbes: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/12/20/operations-research-analyst-the-fastest-growing-job-youve-never-heard-of/amp/" target="_blank">"Operations-research-analyst-the-fastest-growing-job-youve-never-heard-of."</a> Although OR has been around for a long time, its popularity is increasing with its integration with data science. It is an area that can provide you when planned correctly, a profession where you can become a giant team on your own, and work and earn money independent of time and place.
